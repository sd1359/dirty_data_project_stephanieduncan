```

1. Which bird had the most individual sightings?
```{r}
most_individual_sightings <- seabirds %>% 
  group_by(bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, species_abbreviation) %>% 
  summarise(bird_sightings_total = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(bird_sightings_total)) %>% 
  head(1)
```

2. Which bird had the highest total count?


3. Which bird had the highest total count above a latitude of -30?

```{r}
highest_total_count_lat_30 <- seabirds %>% 
  filter(lat > -30) %>% 
  group_by(bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, species_abbreviation) %>% 
  summarise(total_number = sum(number_of_birds)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_number)) %>% 
  head(1)
```


4. How many different types of birds were only ever seen in groups of 1?

```{r}
groups_of_one <- seabirds %>% 
  group_by(bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, species_abbreviation) %>% 
  summarise(group_count = max(number_of_birds)) %>% 
  arrange(group_count) %>% 
  filter(group_count == 1)
```


5. How many penguins were seen? 
```{r}
penguins_seen <- seabirds %>% 
  filter(str_detect(bird_common_name, "[Pp]enguin")) %>% 
  #Checking the number of each type of penguin
  #group_by(bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, species_abbreviation) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_penguins = sum(number_of_birds)) 
#%>% arrange(desc(number_of_penguins))
```
