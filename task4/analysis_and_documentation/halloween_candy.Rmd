```

1. What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (number of candy ratings, not number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)

```{r}
total_ratings <-
halloween_candy %>% 
  filter(!is.na(rating)) %>% 
  summarise(total_ratings = n())

#There are 548814 total ratings.

```

2. What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating and the average age of people not going trick or treating?

```{r}
average_age_trick_or_treating <- halloween_candy %>% 
  group_by(trick_or_treating) %>%
 drop_na() %>% 
  summarise(avg_age = round(mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)))
#The average age of people who are trick or treating is 39 compared to an average age of 42 for those not trick or treating.
```
| trick_or_treating | average_age |
|-------------------|-------------|
| No                | 42          |
| Yes               | 39          |


3. For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these ratings?
```{r}
#Find the ratings total for each bar for each rating
most_rated_candy <- halloween_candy %>% 
   select(candy, rating) %>% 
  filter(rating == c("joy", "despair", "meh")) %>% 
  group_by(candy, rating) %>% 
  count() 

#Show the ratings 
most_rated_candy <- most_rated_candy %>% 
  group_by(rating) %>% 
  slice_max(n) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```
| candy                      | rating  | ratings_count |
|----------------------------|---------|---------------|
| reese_s_peanut_butter_cups | joy     | 3307          |
| gum_from_baseball_cards    | despair | 3265          |

4. How many people rated Starburst as despair?

```{r}
starbust_despair_rating <- halloween_candy %>% 
  filter(candy == "starburst",
         rating == "despair") %>% 
  summarise(total = n())
#1865 people
```

For the next three questions, count despair as -1, joy as +1 and meh as 0.

```{r}
halloween_candy <- halloween_candy %>% 
  filter(rating == c("despair", "joy", "meh")) %>% 
  mutate(rating = case_when(
    rating == "despair" ~ -1, 
    rating == "joy" ~ +1, 
    rating == "meh" ~ 0
  ))
```

  group_by(gender, candy) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(rating)) %>% 
  slice_max(total) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total))
```
